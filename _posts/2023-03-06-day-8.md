# Day 8: String I
---

First day of strings.

### 1. Reverse string

---

The [first question](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string/) is a straightforward `two pointer` question.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void reverseString(vector<char>& s) {
        int left = 0, right = s.size() - 1, temp = 0;
        while (left < right)
        {   
            temp = s[right];
            s[right] = s[left];
            s[left] = temp;
            left++;
            right--;
        }
    }
};
``` 
---
### 2. Reverse String II
---

[The second question](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string-ii/) is slightly more complicated than the first one. The logic is similar. The key is to find the correct condition within the loop. With 
$i+k <= s.size()$, we do not need to worry about the edge case.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string reverseStr(string s, int k) {
        for (int i=0; i<s.size(); i+=2*k)
        {
            if(i+k <= s.size())
                reverse(s.begin()+i, s.begin()+i+k);
            else
                reverse(s.begin()+i, s.end());
        }
        return s;
    }
};
```

### 3. Replacing delimiter
---

The third question does not have an English version. It is as follows: `Given a sentence delimited by space, replace the delimiter by "%20". e.g. "Hello World !" => "Hello%20World%20!".`

There is a very smart way of solving the question: 
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string replaceSpace(string s) {
        int count = 0;
        int sOldSize = s.size();
        for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); i++) {
            if (s[i] == ' ') {
                count++;
            }
        }
        s.resize(s.size() + count * 2);
        int sNewSize = s.size();

        for (int i = sNewSize - 1, j = sOldSize - 1; j < i; i--, j--) {
            if (s[j] != ' ') {
                s[i] = s[j];
            } else {
                s[i] = '0';
                s[i - 1] = '2';
                s[i - 2] = '%';
                i -= 2;
            }
        }
        return s;
    }
};
```   

The ideas is to allocate the memory for the replaced string, and use two pointers from end to front.

### 4. Reverse words in a string
---
The (fourth quesiton)[https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-words-in-a-string/] is quite complicated. The solution consists of two parts.
The first part is a function to reverse the strings in a word. The second part reverse the words in a string of words separated by spaces.

The difficulty lies in the handling of spaces. Again, we use two pointers method to do the check and insertion. Except for the normal procedure, we need to insert a space before each word other than the first one.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void reverse(string& s, int start, int end) {
        for (int i = start, j = end; i < j; i++, j--) {
            swap(s[i], s[j]);
        }
    }
    string reverseWords(string s) {
        reverse(s, 0, s.size() - 1);
        int j = 0;
        for (int i=0; i<s.size(); i++)
        {   
            if (s[i] != ' ')
            {
                if (j != 0)
                    s[j++] = ' ';
                while (s[i] != ' ' && i<s.size())
                    s[j++] = s[i++];
            }
        }
        s.resize(j);

        int k = 0;
        for (int i=0; i<=s.size(); ++i) 
        {
            if (i == s.size() || s[i] == ' ') 
            { 
                reverse(s, k, i-1);
                k=i+1;
            }
        }
        return s;
    }   
};
```

### 5. Left rotate a string
---

The last question is not straightforward, but the solution is simple. The question is just to `rotate a string to the left by the number of characters n. i.e. n=3, "abcdef" => "defabc".`

The solution is to reverse the sub-strings then the whole string.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string reverseLeftWords(string s, int n) {
        reverse(s.begin(), s.begin() + n);
        reverse(s.begin() + n, s.end());
        reverse(s.begin(), s.end());
        return s;
    }
};
```
