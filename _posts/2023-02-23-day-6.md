# Day 6: Hash Map - Part 1

[Hash map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table) is one of the most important data structures in programming. It is a good way of trading space for speed. However, it is not always the best way of solving problems, as we will find out in the following questions.

### 1. Valid Anagram

---

The [first question](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/) is a classic. I was asked this question in an interview, and did not even think of using a hashmap. My solution was just sorting then compare. I can now recall that the interviewer was tring to direct me there. Naturally, I failed, and it was by no means a good experience. I did not like the interviewer at all and the travelling was also unecessary. 

However, the question itself is smart. It shows how a proper use of memory could significantly improve the efficiency.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isAnagram(string s, string t) {
        if (s.size() != t.size())
            return false;
        int record[26] = {0};
        for (int i=0; i<s.size(); i++)
            record[s[i] - 'a']++;

        for (int i=0; i<t.size(); i++)
            record[t[i] - 'a']--;

        for (int i=0; i<26; i++)
        {
            if (record[i])
                return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
};
```

### 2. Happy Number
---

The [next question](https://leetcode.com/problems/happy-number/) is a hard one. Summing is easy once you have a clear head, though the use of hash map is not straightforward. 
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int squaredDigitSum(int n)
    {   
        int sum = 0;
        while (n)
        {
            sum += (n%10)*(n%10);
            n = n/10;
        }
        return sum;
    }
    bool isHappy(int n) {
        unordered_set<int> set;
        int s;
        while (true) {
            s = squaredDigitSum(n); 
            if (s == 1){
                return true;
            }
            if (set.find(s) == set.end())
            {
                set.insert(s);
            }
            else {
                return false;
            }
            n = s;
        }
    }
};
```

### 3. Two Sum

[This](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/) is the first leetcode question. It is not easy to solve if seen the first time. Once the logic is understood, the implementation will be plain.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        unordered_map<int, int> sum_map;
        for (int i=0; i<nums.size(); ++i)
        {   
            auto iter = sum_map.find(target - nums[i]);
            if (iter != sum_map.end())
                return {iter->second, i};
            sum_map[nums[i]] = i;
        }
        return {};
    }
};
```

> Even though we use `unordered_map` in this question, we can use a set to return the pairs, under the condition that we return the actual values not indices.
