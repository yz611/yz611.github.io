### About me

Hello, this is Yichi. Welcome to my blog! 

Currently, I am a junior software engineer working at [BAR Technologies](https://www.bartechnologies.uk/) in [Portsmouth, England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portsmouth). At work, I mainly programme in Python and C++. I have a degree in maths from [St John's College, Cambridge Uni](https://www.joh.cam.ac.uk/mathematics), but most of my daily work are software-related. 

### This blog

I am still quite new to computer science. As I started to work in this field, I realize the necessity of continuous learning. Many programmers I know have a blog to post their thoughts and quirks at work, and it is proven effective for them to develop their skills. Additionally, regular posts push one to keep up with the latest trends in tech. Therefore, it is reasonable for me to start my own.

### Contents

My main focus for now is [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/). In the future, I will include book reviews, language best practices and other areas of computer programming.
